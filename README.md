## Instructions
The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files provided in the Udacity starter kit have been modified to create an interactive game. The project instructions were provided in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

The game is played by clicking on a card to uncover an icon. The player must then find its matching icon by clicking on another card. Only two cards can be selected at a time, so if the cards do not match they are turned back over and the player must start again. If the cards match they both remain uncovered and the player continues the game to uncover other matched icons. When the player has matched all the icons into pairs the game is finished. The player can choose to restart the game and the cards will be shuffled into a new deck order.

The player of the game is required to match the icons into pairs as quickly as possible and a timer will be running throughout. The number of moves a player makes is recorded, and the number of stars they are awarded changes accordingly (the number of stars decreases as the number of moves increases). The player will be notified of the time taken and the number of stars awarded at the end of the game.

## Getting started
Install NPM packages using `npm install`

To run local server use: `npm start`

Go to `localhost:3000` in your browser

## Notes
Some files from the previous project (Portfolio) were reused to get up and running quicky, e.g. the use of `ExpressJS` to set up the local server. 

This project was created as part of my Udacity Front-End Nanodegree, which was awarded through a Google Developer Scholarship. Further functionality and styling may be added and the README will be updated accordingly.
