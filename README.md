## Instructions
The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files provided in the Udacity starter kit have been modified to create an interactive game. The project instructions were provided in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

The player of the game is required to match the icons into pairs as quickly as possible. The number of moves a player makes is recorded, and the number of stars changes accordingly (the number of stars decreases as the number of moves increases). As well as the number of moves and stars, the time it takes to complete the game is recorded.  

## Getting started
Install NPM packages using `npm install`

To run local server use: `npm start`

Go to `localhost:3000` in your browser

## Notes
Some files from the previous project (Portfolio) were reused to get up and running quicky, e.g. the use of `ExpressJS` to set up the local server. 

This project was created as part of my Udacity Front-End Nanodegree, which was awarded through a Google Developer Scholarship. Further functionality and styling may be added and the README will be updated accordingly.
